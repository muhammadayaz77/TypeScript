BUBBLE SORTING : 
COMPLEXITY : 
BEST CASE : O(n) 
=====(already sort)====
if already sort no "swap occur"
so we add "swapped flag"

AVERAGE CASE : O(n^2)
WORSE CASE : O(n^2)

The outer loop runs n times.
The inner loop runs n - 1, n - 2, ..., 1 times.
This results in approximately n² / 2 comparisons → O(n²).
